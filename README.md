#SOLUTION

The code is developed mostly on front end using the files 'index.html', 'style.css' and 'index.js'.
The HTML file determines the inputs and outputs, and also all the parameters that were to be used henceforth. Angular JS is used to easily handle JSON file as well as JS file required for the product.
The CSS file was mostly developed on IDE, and is particularly used for styling.
The JS file manages the input and output parameters, and functions on the GITHUB API and its library functions.
